						Our group's closing balance at the end of this reporting period was £-6,787.04, which was negative because our first loan installment hadn't been paid as of yet, and was also approximately £2,500 less than what was forecast. 
					</li>
					<li>
					There was a noticeable gap between the actual hours our group worked for in comparison to the hours having been forecast (38%, rounded to the nearest whole number), the reasons for which have been explained both in the above process description and the report.

					</li>
					<li>
						The previously described difference between the amount of hours our group worked and the number of hours forecast had actually decreased (22%, rounded to the nearest whole number, for this financial reporting period), which was partly due to the hours spent recreating the multiple versions of the Financial Business Plan.

					</li>
					<li>
						The previously described difference between the amount of hours our group worked and the number of hours forecast had increased significantly (37%, rounded to the nearest whole number, for this financial reporting period), which was mostly due to the fewer hours available to work over the Easter Holidays as well as other coursework deadlines.

					<li>
						However, even the hours worked for the week commencing on 28/5/18 are sufficient proof that the Finance Manager's predictions of the group working for more hours the closer the group was to larger deadlines, such as the First Iteration and the Hand-In of all Deliverables (this past week reducing the percentage difference between the total group's forecast and actual hours worked, for the entire development phase, by approximately 10%, and the actual hours worked for the entire group was 22% (rounded to the nearest whole number) greater than the forecast values), despite examinations and coursework deadlines.

		<h6><u>Key Topics Covered (statistics taken from the final verion of the Financial Performance Review)</u></h6>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The product was to utilise a 'Freemium' pricing strategy, not only because of the potential to unlock viral growth and for AdSense to become a viable revenue stream, but laos because it became apparent to the Financial Manager, through their research, that a Freemium pricing strategy would be a useful way to receive feedback from users, as well as free marketing (via word of mouth).
				</li>
				<li>
					The accompanying pricing strategy was structured by the Finance Manager as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>
							The free version of the app, which was supported with adverts, users:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Would have access to one recipe method/presentation per day, as well as a select number of cooking technique/recipe videos in general.
								</li>
								<li>
									Could create one of their own recipes per month.
								</li>
								<li>
									Could see the popularity of a recipe, as well as the highest-voted comment for that recipe.
								</li>
								<li>
									There would also be adverts in the following formats:
									<ul>
										<li>
											In the recipe method/presentation there would be two native advers in the form of slides, one for a third party and one for the paid version of our product.
										</li>
										<li>
											There would also be one instertitial (/pop-up) advert appearing every 10 minutes, or every time the user exited and re-entered the app.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							The paid version of the app had the following benefits:
							<ul>
								<li>
									There would be no adverts in this version.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user would be able to create as many recipes as they liked.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user could upload shopping lists from the app to the website of any supermarket.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user could also view rough ingredient prices within a recipe's shopping list.
								</li>
								<li>
									In addition, the user would also be on our rewards scheme, where users would received cooking and dining-related vouchers and discounts, as well as even some free items, all for a small subscription fee.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							The paid version would cost £1 per month in the first draft of the Financial Performance Review, and £2 per month in the second, in the forma of a subscription rate. The Finance Manager chose to charge the users in this manner so that the users were not put-off by a hefty price tage for an annual subscription, but the group would generate a longer-lasting income than a one-off purchase.
						</li>
						<li>
							The product price was decided based upon the Marketing Manager's survey, as well as research into what few competitors there were in our target market.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					The profit the Finance Manager calculated that the group would make per financial period was:
					<ul>
						<li>
							£92,326 in the second financial period.
						</li>
						<li>
							£299,539 in the third financial period.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					The net present value was £110,029 including the £50,000 loan, or £60,029 without.
				</li>
				<li>
					The burn rate was -£17,298 per month, meaning that we were making money with each month
				</li>
				<li>
					The Finance Manager decided to use a predicted sales volume of 30,000 year-long subscribers pre churn and retention rates in each financial period (information about sales volume post launch can be found in the Final Draft of the Financial Performance Review, found on the Finance page).
				</li>
				<li>
					The overhead recovery rate was £13.49 in the first financial period, £30.56 in the second and £31.33 in the third.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Finance Manager, based upon research and the duration of the development process, decided the group's Enterprise objectives, both short and long term, as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>Short Term Objectives:</u>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Achieve 30,000 annual subscribers per year at a £2 per month (or £24 annual) subscription rate, including churn and retention rates.
								</li>
								<li>
									Have a volume of approximately 5,000 adverts generating income each year.
								</li>
								<li>
									Spend just under £60,000 on advertising and marketing costs per year.
								</li>
								<li>
									Restrict wage spending to £21,000 to £22,000 per each of our 3 employees per year.
								</li>
								<li>
									Continue with the renting premises and IT service used in the development phase of our app.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Long Term Objectives</u>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Repay our initial £50,000 loan capital.
								</li>
								<li>
									Develop a formal reporting structure and consider incorporation as a private company.
								</li>
								<li>
									Develop a more market-competitive payment structure in order to retain valuable employees as we grow.
								</li>
								<li>
									Expand our business operating capacity and become more self-sufficient through ownership of our own fixed and technological assets (eg: business premises and purchase of our own server).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					The Finance Manager also decided upon the following strategies for the group to implement in order to achieve these objectives:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Providing extensive and round-the-clock technological support for our users.
						</li>
						<li>
							Using our group's age and strong inter-personal skills to our advantage.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Being members of our own target demographic, and in turn our greater insight into what our audience needed/would desire meant that we could have a head-start on future potential competitors.
								</li>
								<li>
									Our inter-personal skills would be used in our videos, at marketing events (such as fresher's fairs), as well as when making deals with brands and other companies.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Our product had the potenetial to generate a strong social media platform community where userd could cook eachother's recipes, this possible even evolving into the creation of in-app 'recipe collections' with chefs and social media influences (an app which offered similar products, except in a different market-exercise-was AFLETE).
						</li>
						<li>
							One of our intentions was to invest as much profit as possible in marketing, in order to initially build a strong brand as quickly as possible, and in turn minimise the risk of larger companies such as Google copying our product and innovative techology.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our group also intended to create a Research and Development department, through which new technologies could be tested in order to strengthen our product and brand through new app features (in turn making our app more 'sticky'), and maybe even create other products to accompany our app.
						</li>
