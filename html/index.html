		<h2>First steps</h2>
		<p><i>17/11/2017 - </i></p>
		<p>
			Our first ever meeting occored on the 17th of November 2017, where we introduced ourselves and got to know one another. During this meeting we outlined our individual strengths and weaknesses as well as how we felt they could be best deployed in the form of group roles. We also made it a priority to decide on the group's objective in terms of what kind of app we would develop.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PRODUCT_IDEA"></div>
		<h4>Generating product ideas</h4>
		<p><i>17/11/2017 - 18/01/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Prior to the first meeting, we agreed on bringing any project ideas to be presented and discussed by the team. The ideas presented were:
			<ul>
				<li>App to teach someone to play a musical instrument (one that canâ€™t play chords)</li>
				<li>App for climbing to find nearby spots, and possibly expand to share climbing achievements on social media and find other climbing enthusiasts</li>
				<li>App to teach children tips and tricks for a device like a raspberry pi</li>
				<li>App to teach someone sign language.</li>
			</ul>
			We discussed these ideas at length, outlining advantages and disadvantages in each. After realising there was no clear victor idea, we decided to give in-depth mini-presentations of our favourite ideas at our following meeting (18/01/2018), some of which were new, and have an election to decide. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The final ideas presented were:
			<ul>
				<li>Lab helper app that gives the user useful tools when working with electronics</li>
				<li>App-based cook book</li>
				<li>App-based travel guide.</li>
			</ul>
			After a round of voting, there was a clear majority for the cook book idea.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we had an idea of what we wanted to do, we were in a position to decide on team roles, and who would occupy them.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="POSITIONS"></div>
		<h4>Positions & elections</h4>
		<p><i>18/01/2018 - 23/01/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Our initial set of roles and occupations we decided on the 18th of January were as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Project Manager: Miranda Lowther</li>
				<li>Software Manager: Jack Rookes</li>
				<li>Finance Manager: Miranda Lowther & J&eacute;r&eacute;my S&eacute;rvoz</li>
				<li>Documentation/QA Manager: Alex Fletcher & Marco Bolt</li>
				<li>Design & Specification Manager: J&eacute;r&eacute;my S&eacute;rvoz</li>
				<li>Hardware & Sound Manager: Alex Bennett</li>
				<li>Marketing Manager / Head of Market Research: StJohn Gidbert</li>
				<li>GUI Manager: Kevin Sum</li>
			</ul>
			however, upon our next meeting a couple of members were concerned about the work load distribution and other commitments, and so we re-discussed our roles an decided on the final group structure shown in the next section.

		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p><i>[INSERT DATES HERE]</i></p>
		<p>
			After assigning group roles, we needed to start planning ahead for the project ahead. A slack group was made for all group communications, and a shared online calendar to keep track of deadlines and events.

		<h4>Project plan & projection</h4>

		<p>
			One of the Team Leader's first major tasks was to outline a project plan, outlining the timing and duration of all tasks to be undertaken. These figures would be used in estimating costs, as well as providing a foundational plan to follow to ensure the success of the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			After an initial prediction and cost analysis was completed, team members raised the concern that the hours were far too optimistic, outlining the difference between our predictions and the predictions of other teams. This led to a project plan overhaul, re-estimating the task durations with worst-case scenarios in mind. For comments, see the project overview document of the Team Leader (Marco Bolt).

		<h2>Finance</h2>
		<div class="anchor" id="TIMESHEETS"></div>
		<h4>Timesheets</h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Initially, our group took a somewhat relaxed approach to the timesheets for this module.</li>
				<li>However, after a week or two a group member began to manage the timesheets (Finance Manager), and a structure was put in place (which was perfected over the course of the module):
					<ul>
						<li>
							A weekly deadline was quickly implemented-the timesheets for a particular week had to be completed and available on the Google Drive before 5pm on the Wednesday of the following week, and for the first few weeks of this system the group was notified on the messenger service we used to discuss anything in relatino to the module (Slack) twice on the day. 
						</li>
						<li>
							This way, the group members had a few days to fill their timesheet in while providing the Finance Manager with sufficient time to conduct analysis and create the Financial Reports.
						</li>
						<li>
							Every Wednesday evening the Finance Manager checked over everyone's timesheet to ensure that the entered information was correct and accurate, and that no information or timesheet was missing.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a timesheet happened to be filled in incorrectly, or was missing alltogether, after the deadline, the Financial Manager gave out warnings for the first two weeks before implementing a discplinary practice: if the timesheet was filled in incorrectly or was missing, then the hours and wages for that person were not going to be recorded, therefore reducing the number of incomplete or missing timesheets to almost none in the following weeks.
						</li>
						<li>
							In order for every member to fully understand, I explained how the timesheet templates worked in one of the group meetings, and answered any questions asked over the duration of the module.
						</li>
						<li>
							From 07/05/18 onwards, this system was handed over to one of the newly appointed Deputy Finance Managers (the Timesheet Manager), while the Finance Manager oversaw the process and had final say on the recording of the hours provided in the timesheets.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Over the process of this module, two timesheet templates were created (the templates are explained in further detail in the Finance section of the tour).</li>
				<li>The final full timesheet was for the week commencing 28/5/18, and an incomplete timesheet for 4/6/18 has also been included.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<div class="anchor" id="FBP"></div>
		<h4>Financial Business Plan</h4>
		<p><i>[09/02/18-22/02/18]</i></p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Financial Business Plan was prepared by the Finance Manager, using the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gannt Chart, and other documents related to the forecast hours our group would work given by the Project Manager (from which forecast wages were calculated for the Cash Flow Forecast). The Finance Manager chose to caculate the wages using direct labour hours rather than assuming that group members would work for 8 hours per day, following discussion with the Financial Adviser, so that the group was only being paid for work done, which would reduce the risk of the loan requested being far greater than what was actually needed.		
				</li>
				<li>
					The Business Plan included a Cash Flow Forecast, calculations of overheads, interest and wages, stated the relevant assumptions, and provided our initial loan request, Â£31,000.
				</li>
				<li>
					While the plan was submitted on time, and the loan request approved, however, it became apparent within days that the hours had been under-predicted (following research as well as discussion with other groups and the Financial Adviser), and so over the next two weeks multiple versions of the WBS were created, from which there were multiple versions of the Financial Business Plan, the Finance Manager ensuring a temporary Financial Business Plan was created and handed out for the Group Tender Presentation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Eventually the final WBS hours were provided, and the final Financial Business Plan was created in two days (two days before the Financial Report One deadline). In the initial version, the Project Manager decided the forecast hours based upon how long it was believed that each task would take. However, over time the method developed into discussing with every group member how long they foresaw tasks they were either already working on, or eventually would, would be.
				</li>
				<li>
					Both the initial and final drafts of the Financial Business Plan are available in the Finance section.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<div class="anchor" id="FRX"></div>
		<h4>Financial reports</h4>
		<p>
			<h5><u>Financial Report One</u></h5>
				<p><i>[Reporting Period: 15/01/18 - 12/02/18]</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
							As previously mentioned, this Financial Report was created within a few days of receiving the final forecast hours in the form of the WBS from the Project Manager, only having a day to complete it after the final Financial Business Plan was submitted.
					</li>
					<li>
						Initially, in order to analyse our efficiency as a group, the Finance Manager outlined that they needed the following documents:
						<ol>
							<li>
									A spreadsheet comparing the actual and forecast hours for each group member, per week, and calculating a percentage difference for the entire group, also per week.
							</li>
							<li>
									A spreadsheet comparing the actual and forecast hours for each group member, per task, per week, which also indicated which hours were spent on what type of task (Meetings, Documentation (such as the Quality Analysis Manual), Finance, Research, and Development (mostly software-related)), as well as what hours were spent on which deliverables for the actual hours worked (in the form of a bar chart) and another bar chart indicating the adherance of our team to the forecast hours.
							</li>
						</ol>
						These particular documents were chosen following discussion with the Financial Adviser, and because it would enable the Finance Manager to analyse the efficiency of each member of our group, as well as how we were adhering to our forecast wages, a useful indicator for our work potential as larger deadlines, such as the First Iteration.
					</li>
					<li>
						However, as mentioned in the section covering the creation of the WBS, the software used (Microsoft Project) for the creation of the WBS and Gannt Chart distributed the hours in a manner that was undesirable (it would have been preferable for the hours to be greater for the related task as the deadline for the task approached, however the hours for all tasks were evenly distributed throughout the development phase, which resulted in the appearance that our group's actual hours were not being spent on the tasks as forecasted/needed).
					</li>
					<li>
						Given the proximity of the deadline after the Financial Business Plan final draft submission, the Financial Manager delegated the second of these spreadsheets, which was eventually referred to as the 'Analysis Document' to certain group members (Marco, St.John and Jack at first) to fill in. The Finance Manager oversaw the process while completing the rest of the report, and when this document was complete they read through and corrected the spreadsheet accordingly.
					</li>
					<li>
