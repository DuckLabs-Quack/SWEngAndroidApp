		<h2>First steps</h2>
		<p><i>17/11/2017 - </i></p>
		<p>
			Our first ever meeting occurred on the 17th of November 2017, where we introduced ourselves and got to know one another. During this meeting we outlined our individual strengths and weaknesses as well as how we felt they could be best deployed in the form of group roles. We also made it a priority to decide on the group's objective in terms of what kind of app we would develop.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PRODUCT_IDEA"></div>
		<h4>Generating product ideas</h4>
		<p><i>17/11/2017 - 18/01/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Prior to the first meeting, we agreed on bringing any project ideas to be presented and discussed by the team. The ideas presented were:
			<div class="quote">
				<ul>
					<li>App to teach someone to play a musical instrument (one that canâ€™t play chords)</li>
					<li>App for climbing to find nearby spots, and possibly expand to share climbing achievements on social media and find other climbing enthusiasts</li>
					<li>App to teach children tips and tricks for a device like a raspberry pi</li>
					<li>App to teach someone sign language.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			We discussed these ideas at length, outlining advantages and disadvantages in each. After realising there was no clear victor idea, we decided to give in-depth mini-presentations of our favourite ideas at our following meeting (18/01/2018), some of which were new, and have an election to decide. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The final ideas presented were:
			<div class="quote">
				<ul>
					<li>Lab helper app that gives the user useful tools when working with electronics</li>
					<li>App-based cook book</li>
					<li>App-based travel guide.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			After a round of voting, there was a clear majority for the cook book idea.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we had an idea of what we wanted to do, we were in a position to decide on team roles, and who would occupy them.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="POSITIONS"></div>
		<h4>Positions & elections</h4>
		<p><i>18/01/2018 - 23/01/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Our original set of roles and occupations we decided on the 18th of January were as follows:
			<div class="quote">
				<b>Original Roles:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Project Manager: Miranda Lowther</li>
					<li>Software Manager: Jack Rookes</li>
					<li>Finance Manager: Miranda Lowther & J&eacute;r&eacute;my S&eacute;rvoz</li>
					<li>Documentation/QA Manager: Alex Fletcher & Marco Bolt</li>
					<li>Design & Specification Manager: J&eacute;r&eacute;my S&eacute;rvoz</li>
					<li>Hardware & Sound Manager: Alex Bennett</li>
					<li>Marketing Manager / Head of Market Research: StJohn Gilbert</li>
					<li>GUI Manager: Kevin Sum</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			however, upon our next meeting a couple of members were concerned about the work load distribution and other commitments, and so we re-discussed our roles an decided on the final group structure shown in the next section.

		<div class="anchor" id="GETTING_STARTED"></div>
		<h2>Documentation Process</h2>
		<p>
			After assigning group roles, we needed to start planning ahead for the project ahead. A slack group was made for all group 
			communications, and a shared online calendar to keep track of deadlines and events. Group meetings were scheduled regularly, eventually taking the form of
			3pm on Mondays in the Library; all meetings were minuted by the QA/Documentation Manager and are available <a href="documentation.html#meetingminutes">here.</a></p></p>
			
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="QA_MANUAL"></div>
		<h4>QA Manual</h4>
		<p><i>01/02/2018 onwards</i></p>
		<p>
			A thoroughly thought out QA Manual is imperative to the group's success as without it roles and tasks are not properly defined and therefore group members will be unable to focus on what is required from them. The First Iteration of the QA Manual was edited and compiled by the QA & Documentation manager with all individual group members providing the content for their respective sections; not that the Software Manager and QA/Doc Manager created the role definition for Software Engineer.
		</p>
		<p> 
			As the project progressed it became clear that changes were required; the initial version and the current version of the QA Manual are available <a href="documentation.html#QA_Manual">here</a> as well as some notes documenting the changes between the two.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="QA_Assessment_Sheets"></div>
		<h4>QA Self-Assessment Sheets 1 & 2</h4>
		<p> 
			Twice during the project, QA self-assessment sheets were filled in by all group members and then reviewed by the QA Manager to ensure that work was being conducted effectively with no internal issues. Any points made on these sheets were brought up and discussed in the <a href="documentation.html#meetingminutes">meetings.</a>
		</p>
		<p> 
			The filled in Self-Assessment sheets, template and review document are available on the Documentation page of this website <a href="documentation.html#selfAss">here</a>
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="USER MANUAL"></div>
		<h4>User Manual</h4>
		<p>
			A User Manual is an essential piece of documentation for any piece of software. The user manual was created in line with others found online and gives a guideline for any prospective user on how to use the application. The User Manual also includes FAQ and help/support style questions. The HANDS OFF User Manual can be viewed <a href="documentation.html#usermanual">here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PROJECT_PLAN"></div>
		<h4>Project plan & projection</h4>
		<p><i>05/02/2018 - 21/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			One of the Team Leader's first major tasks was to outline a project plan, outlining the timing and duration of all tasks to be undertaken. These figures would be used in estimating costs, as well as providing a foundational plan to follow to ensure the success of the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			After an initial prediction and cost analysis was completed, team members raised the concern that the hours were far too optimistic, outlining the difference between our predictions and the predictions of other teams. This led to a project plan overhaul, re-estimating the task durations with worst-case scenarios in mind. For comments, see the project overview document of the Team Leader (Marco Bolt).

		<h2>Finance</h2>
		<div class="anchor" id="TIMESHEETS"></div>
		<h4>Timesheets</h4>
		<p>Initially, our group took a somewhat relaxed approach to the timesheets for this module. However, after a week or two a group member began to manage the timesheets (Finance Manager), and a structure was put in place (which was perfected over the course of the module):
			<ul>
				<li>
					A weekly deadline was quickly implemented-the timesheets for a particular week had to be completed and available on the Google Drive before 5pm on the Wednesday of the following week, and for the first few weeks of this system the group was notified on the messenger service we used to discuss anything in relation to the module (Slack) twice on the day. 
				</li>
				<li>
					This way, the group members had a few days to fill their timesheet in while providing the Finance Manager with sufficient time to conduct analysis and create the Financial Reports.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every Wednesday evening the Finance Manager checked over everyone's timesheet to ensure that the entered information was correct and accurate, and that no information or timesheet was missing.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a timesheet happened to be filled in incorrectly, or was missing alltogether, after the deadline, the Financial Manager gave out warnings for the first two weeks before implementing a discplinary practice: if the timesheet was filled in incorrectly or was missing, then the hours and wages for that person were not going to be recorded, therefore reducing the number of incomplete or missing timesheets to almost none in the following weeks.
				</li>
				<li>
					In order for every member to fully understand, I explained how the timesheet templates worked in one of the group meetings, and answered any questions asked over the duration of the module.
				</li>
				<li>
					From 07/05/18 onwards, this system was handed over to one of the newly appointed Deputy Finance Managers (the Timesheet Manager), while the Finance Manager oversaw the process and had final say on the recording of the hours provided in the timesheets.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Over the process of this module, two timesheet templates were created (the templates are explained in further detail in the Finance section of the tour), and the final full timesheet was for the week commencing 28/5/18 (an incomplete timesheet for 4/6/18 has also been included).</p>
		<div class="anchor" id="FBP"></div>
		<h4>Financial Business Plan</h4>
		<p><i>[09/02/18-22/02/18]</i></p>
		<h6><u>The Process</u></h6>
		<p>The Financial Business Plan was prepared by the Finance Manager, using the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gannt Chart, and other documents related to the forecast hours our group would work given by the Project Manager (from which forecast wages were calculated for the Cash Flow Forecast). The Finance Manager chose to calculate the wages using direct labour hours rather than assuming that group members would work for 8 hours per day, following discussion with the Financial Adviser, so that the group was only being paid for work done, which would reduce the risk of the loan requested being far greater than what was actually needed.</p>	
		<p>The Business Plan included a Cash Flow Forecast, calculations of overheads, interest and wages, stated the relevant assumptions, and provided our initial loan request, Â£31,000. While the plan was submitted on time, and the loan request approved, however, it became apparent within days that the hours had been under-predicted (following research as well as discussion with other groups and the Financial Adviser), and so over the next two weeks multiple versions of the WBS were created, from which there were multiple versions of the Financial Business Plan, the Finance Manager ensuring a temporary Financial Business Plan was created and handed out for the Group Tender Presentation. Eventually the final WBS hours were provided, and the final Financial Business Plan was created in two days (two days before the Financial Report One deadline). In the initial version, the Project Manager decided the forecast hours based upon how long it was believed that each task would take. However, over time the method developed into discussing with every group member how long they foresaw tasks they were either already working on, or eventually would, would be.</p>
		<p><i>Both the initial and final drafts of the Financial Business Plan are available in the Finance section.</i></p>
		<div class="anchor" id="FRX"></div>
		<h4>Financial reports</h4>
		<h5><u>Financial Report One</u></h5>
		<p><i>[Reporting Period: 15/01/18 - 18/02/18]</i></p>
		<h6><u>The Process</u></h6>
		<p>As previously mentioned, this Financial Report was created within a few days of receiving the final forecast hours in the form of the WBS from the Project Manager, only having a day to complete it after the final Financial Business Plan was submitted. Initially, in order to analyse our efficiency as a group, the Finance Manager outlined that they needed the following documents:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A spreadsheet comparing the actual and forecast hours for each group member, per week, and calculating a percentage difference for the entire group, also per week.
				</li>
				<li>
					A spreadsheet comparing the actual and forecast hours for each group member, per task, per week, which also indicated which hours were spent on what type of task (Meetings, Documentation (such as the Quality Analysis Manual), Finance, Research, and Development (mostly software-related)), as well as what hours were spent on which deliverables for the actual hours worked (in the form of a bar chart) and another bar chart indicating the adherance of our team to the forecast hours. This document was included in the report submission as an appendix.
				</li>
			</ol>
		<p>These particular documents were chosen following discussion with the Financial Adviser, and because it would enable the Finance Manager to analyse the efficiency of each member of our group, as well as how we were adhering to our forecast wages, a useful indicator for our work potential as larger deadlines, such as the First Iteration. However, as mentioned in the section covering the creation of the WBS, the software used (Microsoft Project) for the creation of the WBS and Gannt Chart distributed the hours in a manner that was undesirable (it would have been preferable for the hours to be greater for the related task as the deadline for the task approached, however the hours for all tasks were evenly distributed throughout the development phase, which resulted in the appearance that our group's actual hours were not being spent on the tasks as forecasted/needed).</p>
		<p>Given the proximity of the deadline after the Financial Business Plan final draft submission, the Financial Manager delegated the second of these spreadsheets, which was eventually referred to as the 'Analysis Document' to certain group members (Marco, St.John and Jack at first) to fill in. The Finance Manager oversaw the process while completing the rest of the report, and when this document was complete they read through and corrected the spreadsheet accordingly.When the Finance Manager reviewed the Analysis Document, it became apparent that the hours forecast per person were different to the hours forecast per task type, and following discussion with the Project Manager about this issue, the Finance Manager created another spreadsheet highlighting this discrepency and explaining as such.</p>
		<p>As well as the aforementioned documents, the Finance Manager looked into what deadlines they and their fellow members had before writing up week-by-week explanations, highlighting the Microsoft Project software issue as well as explaining the ways in whichthe actual and forecast hours varied, both from a quantitative (ie: total actual hours per role, per week) and qualitative (ie: hours per week per task-type) perspective. They also followed the common accounting practice of outlining where assumptions were made (such as ignoring advertising costs, because the duration of the module only covered the development phase and therefore our product was never going to be launched, a viewpoint confirmed as correct by the Financial Adviser (the Finance Manager had regular meetings with the Financial Adviser in order to ensure that they produced the reports and other work as desired)).</p>
		<p> For this document submission, the Finance Manager included Analysis Document as an appendix, however in retrospect they would have included a copy of the Cash Flow Statement as an appendix, which was carried out in the rest of the reports. Also, another change that was made to subsequent reports was that the Cash Flow Statement, that included the forecast and actual values, as well as the variance between them, per week in this report, which the Finance Manager concluded was slightly cumbersome, the method being replace in future reports with a Cash Flow Statement that was a hybrid of actual and forecast values (actual until the final full timesheet was available, forecast for the following weeks), an approach which was particularly efficient, especially with the addition of a section under the Cash Flow Statement comparing the actual and forecast opening and closing balance, as well as the variance inbetween. This approach was preferred in future as it was easier to automatically view how much of our budget was left after entering the actual values.</p>
		<h5><u>Financial Report Two</u></h5>
		<p><i>[Reporting Period: 19/02/18 - 04/03/18]</i></p>
		<h6><u>The Process</u></h6>
		<p>Learning from approaches taken in Financial Report One, the Finance Manager updated the now hybrid Cash Flow Statement (which was also included as an appendix, along with the Analysis Document) on a weekly basis, which enabled the Finance Manager to provide accurate information about our group's financial position on demand, which was useful during meetings (This practice was implemented because the Cash Flow Statement had previously been created in a rush, with no weekly updates, which, while partly because of the lack of management of timesheets, clearly had the potential to become a significant problem in the future.). In addition, a red line running along the right hand side of the column for the latest week of recorded actual hours worked, which was updated with the rest of the Cash Flow Statement, and enabled the reader to notice the change from forecast to actual values with more ease.</p>
		<p>While the reporting period was only over the course of two weeks (during which the first loan payment occured), the Finance Manager took the opportunity of the shorter reporting period to implement these new techniques before reports that would cover longer periods of time (such as Financial Report 3) would require completion. Other than the changes described, the report followed a similar stucture to the last and outlined issues related to the planning software used, again explaining that the hours that were allocated over these weeks for development of our app would be used closer to the deadline, when there was a clearer plan for delegation of user stories, as well as when all user stories for this iteration had been decided</p>
		<h5><u>Financial Report Three</u></h5>
		<p><i>[Reporting Period: 05/03/18 - 29/04/18]</i></p>
		<h6><u>The Process</u></h6>
		<p>During the covered reporting period, the second loan installment was paid and the contracts were agreed, the code for which was created and submitted/received (please see the contracts section for further details on the agreements made with each group). Our group made aggreements to 'sell' code to two groups, as well as 'buy' code from these same groups. It was agreed that, since we were buying code from, and selling code to eachother, the contracts would be the same amount (which for each of our contracts was Â£500). In accordance with the Finance briefing notes, the three payments were as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Â£125 was paid upon placement of the contract (27/02/18).
				</li>
				<li>
					Â£250 was paid upon handover of the code (16/04/18)
				</li>
				<li>
					Â£125 was paid upon acceptance of the code (week of 16/04/18)
				</li>
			</ul>
		Since the handover and acceptance of code occured in the same week, the payments in the Cash Flow were Â£125 in the week commencing 26/02/18, and Â£375 in the week commencing 16/04/18 (which was also the week in which the second installment of the loan was paid).</p>
		<p>For this report, the Cash Flow Statement's previously red line, which divided weeks of actual values from weeks of forecast values, was replaced with a three-colour line system, indicating when the last financial report was submitted, the current week, and the week of the submission of the next financial report. This enabled the Finance Manager to keep track of the group's financial position with even more ease, combined with the continued weekly updates.</p>
		<p>The weekly update of the Cash Flow Statement and accompanying spreadsheets (except for the Analysis Document, which was filled in the week of by both the Finance Manager and a couple of the other members of the group) was continued over the course of this reporting period, which therefore made the submission of this particular document less intense for the Finance Manager than it had been. In addition to the Cash Flow Statement, the Analysis Document, the spreadsheet outlining the quantitative adherance of the group to the hours predicted by the Project Manager, the Finance Manager also created a spreadsheet analysing how closely each group member in particular was adhering to their predicted hours, both on a weekly basis and cumulatively over the course of the project (a document which also proved to be useful for analysing how long each group member was working during the development phase), as well as procuring a document fromt he Software Manager that described which features of the app had been implemented on a particular datem another way to learn about the efficiency of our group members. These documents, along with copies of the contracts, formed the accompanying appendicies for this particular report.</p>
		<p>It should also be noted that the month-long Easter Holidays occurred during this time period, which resulted in a lapse in the number of hours worked.</p>

		<h2>Marketing</h2>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="Market Research and Analysis"></div>
		<h4>Market Research and Analysis</h4>
		<p>
			Market research was an ongoing process throughout the development phase however at first there was a lot of time spent on researching what the market is, what already exists and which target audience we should create our product for. Keeping in mind the 4 Ps of marketing: product,price, promotion and place, the marketing manager scrutinized existing apps and cooking websites to see what worked and what didn't work. A lot of time was spent interacting with these products to really get a feel for what a good cooking app should be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reviews provided a great insight to what customers liked and disliked and this feedback was used to give the group an indication to the group of how the app should be designed and the functionality of the product. The notes made by the marketing manager during the market research phase are available on the research page under <a href="research.html#Research"> Market Research Document.</a>
		<p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="Target Audience"></div>
		<h4>Target Audience Research</h4>
		<p>
			Upon realising a gap in the market for a cooking app aimed at 18 - 30 year olds, an in depth analysis of our target audience was also carried out to really get to grips with who we are aiming this product at and how to capture their attention. Information about our audience, their ideology and habits is also noted in the <a href="research.html#Research">'Market Research Document'</a>  as well as primary research carried out in the form of a survey. 
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="Sales Strategy and Marketing Plan"></div>
		<h4>Sales Strategy and Marketing Plan</h4>
		<p>
			From the market and audience research a tailored <a href="research.html#Research">marketing strategy</a> was developed taking into account how and where the product will be marketed. The research section also includes emails that were sent to parent companies of strong brands among our target audience with aim to generate links with them and to investigate the likelihood of sourcing samples and other products to give away in our exclusive rewards club. Their responses have also been noted, please note that to contact Cadbury's, the marketing manager had to fill out an on-line form rather than sending an email however the content of this form has been put in a letter and added to the research folder. 
		</p>
		<h4>Outcomes from Market Research</h4>
		<p>
			The information gathered from the market research influenced the final outcome of the product greatly. By gaining the solid foundation dand understanding of the market and audience the product was tailored to suit. Examples of this are as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>Layout and theme </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Scrutiny and reviews of competitors revealed what successful apps look like and this information was fed back to the design team</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Features</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Once again scrutiny and reviews provided a great insight into what desirable features successful similar app included
			and aided in the development of the functionality of the product</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Pricing Strategy and Business Model</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				From the primary research carried out and market research a business model was agreed upon with the finance manager. The type of adverts we are using was decided upon based upon the marketing managers experiences and reviews of products with adverts nested in them
			</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
			A document detailing how the market research influenced the final outcome of the product can be found <a href="research.html#Research">here</a> under 'Outcomes From Market Research' or by opening the research page. The page includes all relevant documents used for marketing, please feel to view at your leisure.

		<h2>Design & specification</h2>
		<p><i>22/01/2018 - 02/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Once the enterprise was set up, it was time to start visualising what our app would look like and how it would behave. As well as providing a template for the software development team, this also had the purpose of enticing investors in our project.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="FUNCTIONAL_SPEC"></div>
		<h4>Defining product specification</h4>
		<p><i>18/01/2018 - 02/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			From meeting 2 (18/01/2018) we already had a good idea of what we wanted the product to do. A set of basic functionalities were outlined as follows (Taken directly from the meeting minutes):
			<div class="quote">
				<ul>
					<li>The app is a cooking app with recipes available for the user to have access to via a server</li>
					<li>A shopping list will be available for each recipe, and available to be downloaded for when there isnâ€™t an internet connection</li>
					<li>One of the main USPâ€™s of the product is that it displays the recipe instructions/steps in a slideshow format, and that the user can switch between steps in a manner (to be finalised) that would require minimal usage of their hands, which would be useful for many recipes</li>
					<li>The app will have the optional function of also playing a recording of someone reading the recipe steps</li>
					<li>People will be able to add their own recipes, and in future iterations it would be an aim to have affiliates who would sell their recipes (possibly in the form of ebooks) on our app, from which we would make commission.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PRODUCT_DESIGN"></div>
		<h4>Product design</h4>
		<p><i>26/01/2018 - 19/02/2018</i></p>
		<p> We started working on the design during the design meeting(26/01/2018), during this meeting we laid down on paper our first ideas for the layout of the app. We drew all the pages we thought we needed for the app thinking about the interaction between them and aiming for easy to use interface.

				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> We then used proto.io, an app prototyping service to design the app and the interactions within.

		<div class="anchor" id="TENDER_PRESENTATION"></div>
		<h2>Group tender presentation</h2>
		<p><i>19/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			The tender presentation was made to entice potential investors in our product. It was created with the aim of getting our audience to engage with our product by visualizing our app in use, as well as reinforcing faith in our project with a well designed financial business plan. Unfortunately, as aforementioned in the Finance section, we realized our initial request was too low, and so the presented financial business plan was an updated version to that which had been submitted. The presentation was led by the Team Leader, with the Marketing Manager, Finance Manager and Design Team presenting individual sections. 
		</p>
		Files:

		<div class="anchor" id="IMPLEMENTATION"></div>
		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p><i>12/02/2018 - present</i></p>
		<p>
			Now that our loan from our Financial Adviser/Investor had been approved, we were ready to begin development of the app. As outlined in the QA Manual, we deployed an Agile programming methodology, following a series of programmer stories in realising our designs and specifications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Programming technically started on the 15th of January, however that was the Software Manager setting up the project and getting everything ready. Programming actually started gaining momentum after the group Tender presentation. 
		</p>
		<div class="anchor" id="PROTOTYPE"></div>
		<h4>Version 1: Prototype</h4>
		<p><i>15/01/2018 - 16/03/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			The development of the prototype could be split into several sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Server</li>
				<li>Functionality</li>
				<li>GUI</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>Server</b></p>
		<p>
			The server was written in python utilising the "Flask" microframework. This was a system that would handle basic http requests, and pass information to any connected instances of the app.
		</p>
		<p><b>Functionality</b></p>
		<p>
			The functionality development consisted largely of data handling and management. For the prototype, this included:
			<ul>
				<li>Data handling</li>
				<li>XML Parsing</li>
				<li>Filtering</li>
				<li>Generating & drawing recipe thumbnails to screen</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>GUI</b></p>
		<p>
			GUI development saw the generation of the page template files, and code that interfaced with it. The tasks involved in GUI implementation for the prototype included:
			<ul>
				<li>Layout descriptions (XML)</li>
				<li>Activity code (making each page displayable in the app)</li>
				<li>Interfacing with objects on screen</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The prototype as on submission on Friday 16th March is demonstrated in a demo video below:
			<Video src="Resources/Videos/HandsOffDemo1.mp4" class="polaroid" style="display: block; width: 90%; max-width: 500px; margin: 10px auto;" controls></video>
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="RELEASE"></div>
		<h4>Version 2: Release</h4>
		<p><i>16/04/2018 - present</i></p>
		<p>
			The second stage of the development pushed away from a proof of concept, and started filling in the gaps and templates with functional code. As with the prototype stage, the development could be split into the three sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Server</li>
				<li>Functionality</li>
				<li>GUI</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>Server</b></p>
		<p>
			Server development saw security improvement, as well as expanding the servers ability to transfer files, with the aim of storing all files related to a recipe locally on the server. The full list of server-side developments is:
			<ul>
				<li>Security Improvements</li>
				<li>Presentation transfer</li>
				<li>Image transfer</li>
				<li>Video transfer</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>Functionality</b></p>
		<p>
			The functionality development was a continuation of the prototype functionalities, as well as methods to determine the contents of the GUI. This included:
			<ul>
				<li>Search algorithm</li>
				<li>Recipe suggestion algorithm</li>
				<li>In-app recipe creation</li>
				<li>Image downloading and management</li>
				<li>Video streaming</li>
				<li>Haptic feedback</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>GUI</b></p>
		<p>
			GUI development for the release version was more of the same. New pages were created, and layouts were updated and improved.
		</p>

		<h4>Project-wide standards</h4>
		<p><i>13/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			On the 13th of Febuary, representetives of each team gathered to discuss the project-wide standards, and how to define them. These standards would be applied to the presentation tool that would be implemented in each of our products.This process was largely led by Lauren Thomasello and Zak West, and resulted in an xml schema that would be used when developing presentations.

		<div class="anchor" id="TESTING"></div>
		<h2>Testing</h2>
		<p><i>04/06/2018 - 06/06/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Testing was conducted following a Testing and Integration spreadsheet created by the Software manager. This can be found <a href="Resources/Documents/Testing and Integration plan.xlsx">here</a>.
			</p>
		<p>
			Testing was broken down into 5 test sets, which were to be worked through in order. These sets are as follows; First Iteration, Second iteration (Mandatory), Second iteration (Desirables), Second iteration (Optional) and contract code tests.
		</p> 
		<p>
			To pass a test, the app must be capable of completeing the function required of it as specified in the testing sheet. If a test were to fail, then the testing process would be paused whilst the issue was rectified. Once fixed, the test could be marked as a pass. If an issue could not be fixed for whatever reason, then the test would be marked as a failure, however this did not occur during testing of the Hands Off application. If the criteria for a test was not met and there was no evidence of the code having been developed, the test would be marked as missing. When testing was completed, the tests that were marked as missing, would be reviewed and if possible, added to the project by team members.

		<div class="anchor" id="FINANCE_SUMMARY"></div>
		<h2>Financial Summary</h2>
		<p><i>[07/05/2018 - Present]</i></p>
		<p>As the develpoment phase of our app drew to a close, the Finance Manager created a Financial Performance Review as well as a Fourth Financial Report. While Financial Report Four was not required, nor was it described as a deliverable, the Finance Manager believed that it was necessary to prove the predictions that had been made in previous reports, that the closer to deadlines such as the First Iteration and the end of the development phase the group was, the more hours would be spent.</p>
		<p>It should also be noted that, from 07/05/18, the Finance Manager had 2 deputies-one for research, and one for handling timesheets (as explained in the previous section on Financial Reports 1 to 3). The decision was made to create these roles by the Finance Manager in order to alleviate some of the pressure at this particular time of year, combined with their ill-health, and multiple group members were more than happy to take on these roles.</p>
		<h4>Financial Performance Review/Financial Summary Report</h4>
		<h6><u>The Process:</u></h6>
		<p>In preparation for the creation of this report, the Finance Manager worked with the Deputy Finance (Research) Manager to conduct research into areas such as product pricing and sales volumes, which combined with the survey conducted by the Marketing Manager resulted in the Finance Manager deciding the sales volume (pre churn and retention rates) and the product price. In addition, research was conducted into typical costs of renting and owning a server, as well as typical salaries for people working at start-ups, which, combined with the Finance Manager's own research, served as the foundation upon which it was decided the salaries for the three employees working at the Enterprise after the launch of our product.</p>
		<p>The Finance Manager also had multiple meetings with the Financial Adivser in order to truly understand how to decide the price for the group's produce, as well as what other ratios they needed to calculate, and asked the Project Manager to create an Executive Summary, which the Finance Manager eventually updated.</p>
		<p>Using the information procured through these meetings, as well as group research and information learnt through creation of the Financial Reports, the Finance Manager subsequently created the first draft for the Financial Summary Report, including an updated Cash Flow Statement (so that the most accurate closing balance for the development phase was used) as well as the Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet across the decided reporting period.</p>
		<p>The Finance Manager, following discussion with the Financial Adviser, eventually decided to report on three financial periods, one being the development phase (lasting 24 weeks), and the other two being the two years following product launch. This was because of how volatile the app market is, the lack of predictability meaning that the market is very unstable, and therefore it would be best to keep the reporting period short in order to use statistics for predictions such as possible sales volume.</p>
		<p>In addition to the aforementioned documents, the Finance Manager carried out a SWOT analysis, decided the company objectives over the decided reporting period (as well as longer-term), calculated the financial analysis ratios they decided were appropriate (such as net present value and burn rate, though the use of full absorption cost + margin was avoided because product pricing should be based upon what the market could tolerate). These ratios, amongst other pieces of information were included in notes sections that accompantied the Cash Flow Statement, Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet.</p>
		<p>The research conducted by the Finance Manager and Deputy Finance (Research) Manager was compiled into an appendix (See the Finance and the Research sections), an appendix which also included almost all research conducted by the Finance Manager for the duration of the development phase. Included, along with this appendix, was the updated Cash Flow Statement as another appendix.</p>
		<p>However, while the first draft of the Financial Performance Review was submitted on-time, a few days later the Deputy Finance (Research) Manager contacted the Finance Manager, informing them of a clerical error in their research which resulted in the product price being twice what it was, and therefore having a large impact on the report. The Finance Manager re-created the document over the following 10 days, despite ill-health, and took the opportunity to make the following main changes:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Additional appendices were included to accompany the document and its current appendices-a document analysing the variance between forecast and actual hours worked per group member on a weekly bases as well as a collection of the references used throughout the report and its appendices.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Finance Manager took the opportunity to also ammend the report according to current churn and retention rates because otherwise our pricing strategy would be wildly inaccurate it would be unlikely that every user who purchased the paid version of the app would continue to use it each year.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><i>(The final draft can be found on the <a href="finance.html">Finance page</a>, along with all other copies of any Finance documents.)</i></p>
		
		<h4>Financial Report 4</h4>
		<h6><u>The Process:</u></h6>
		<p>Given that the Finance Manager had already created 3 Financial Reports previously, they decided to create a fourth in order to prove that the gorup did work more hours the closer the group was to larger deadlines such as the First Iteration and the end of the development phase.The procedure carried out to create this report by the finance Manager was very similar to the procedure implemented for Financial Report 3, though the main difference was that for the Analysis Document, following the aforementioned meeting, was filled in by the Deputry Finance (Timesheet) Manager.</p>
		<p>This report covered a period of time during which the group had multiple coursework deadlines and exams, and the Finance Manager was unweel, but the Cash Flow Statement and other hours analysis documents were still updated on a weekly basis, and the report is available on the <a href="finance.html">Finance page of this tour.</a></p>
		<p>Appendices</p>

		<h4>Summary</h4>
		<p>While there were occasional issues with finding accurate statistics, since the app market is new in comparison to many other markets, as well as the occasional clerical error, the financial reporting process was a relatively smooth one, where the Finance Manager worked as hard as possible, along with certain group members, as described in the sections above, to ensure that the information provided was accurate, useful and in as much depth as possible.</p>
