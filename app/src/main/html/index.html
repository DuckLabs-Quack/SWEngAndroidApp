			<h2>First Steps:</h2>
			Our group began work on the project by choosing our individual roles. By doing this, we could split the overall project into manageable chunks for each person in the team. As we have 8 people in our group, we split into 8 roles consisting of a Project Manager, Finance Manager, Software Manager, GUI Manager, Documentation Manager, Design Manager, Multimedia and Content Manager and finally a Marketing Manager.
			Once each role was taken, the next step was to choose a topic that we would base our project around. During initial project meetings there were multiple ideas that were put forward, including a Lab Helper app, climbing app and an app to help learn an instrument. Eventually, after a few rounds of voting, we were able to come to a consensus as a group and chose to focus on a Cooking application to help people learn to cook as well as try new dishes and share them with their friends. We decided to call our company 'SWeng Group 3 Enterprise' and commissioned a Slack channel, Google Team Drive and a Google Calendar to aid in communication and file storage/sharing between the project group.

		<h2>Researching the competition:</h2>
		After deciding on a direction for our project. The marketing manager began to source information regarding existing apps and market conditions for an app such as this. There are many cooking apps already in circulation, so the aim of this research was to find the general strengths and weaknesses of the current apps and use this to our advantage by making it so that our app solved all the problems that users were having with other apps at the time, therefore making it a more attractive choice to download and use. This research revealed that we should use in-app advertisements to generate income without putting users off with expensive subscription fees. As well as this, the app should be based around minimal contact with the device which was a problem many users had with current apps, as they could not use the app efficiently when they had dirty hands from cooking. With this in mind, we decided to call our app 'Hands Off' as an indication that our app would need minimal contact to use which is what users desired most.

		<h2>The First Iteration:</h2>
		<p>
			<h4>Initial Documentation:</h4>
			After extensive research and planning, our group started work first iteration of the application. The first deadline for our group was to write a detailed functional specification, followed closely by a quality assurance manual for our project. These documents were key to getting started with app development, as they outlined the roadmap for our project. Some of the things that can be found in these documents include who would focus on which sections of the app and how it would all be coded and brought together whilst maintaining high standards and adhering to strict deadlines and project requirements. All members of the group contributed towards writing these documents and they were then proof read and readied for submission by the Documentation Manager.
			Whilst the group worked on these documents, the Finance manager was also writing up a financial business plan for 'SWeng Group 3 Enterprise', including how we would make money from the app, how much it would cost to develop and the wages that company staff would be paid for the hours that they worked. Also, during this time, the project wide standards document was being developed by the lead programmer and project manager with collaboration from other project groups to make sure that there were a set of clearly defined standard practices to be conformed to between groups which would make buying and selling contracts between groups much easier.

			<h4>Group tender presentations:</h4>
			During the PWS negotiations, the Design manager, along with the GUI manager and Multimedia and content manager began work on the design prototype of the app that could be used in the upcoming tender presentation to showcase our ideas as well as to get a feel for how the app would work. The decision was made between the group to have the initial mock-up designed for use on android smartphones which were the main source of downloads for applications such as ours. The design mock-up was created using an online app development tool called Proto.io which would show the skeleton of our app and could be used to see what the GUI would look like and to play with ideas before committing to coding them. The GUI developer worked on designing the individual GUI pages that the app would have whilst the Multimedia and Content Manager worked on the graphics, videos and sounds that would be used in the application around the various areas of the app. The design manager oversaw the decisions made by the design team and relayed information between them and the rest of the group whilst also continuing to update and create the app mock-up on Proto.io with the content being created.
			Once the app mock-up was created, the group held meetings to write a script and to practice our tender presentation. We included explanations of the product idea, our QA and design philosophy, the costing of our app using information included in the FBP and a walkthrough of the app mock-up and the features it contained. The aim of this tender presentation was to convince the chief customer and financial backer to support our company's product and to agree to finance us for the duration of the projects development.

			<h4>Programming standards and contracts:</h4>
			Once the tender presentation was complete, our group got the go ahead to begin development of our application with the funding provided by the financial backer. The project schedule had been laid down and the app platform was agreed on by the group. The application would run on Smartphones and Tablets and would be coded using Android Studio in the java programming language. Coding practices and regulations that had been agreed upon in the PWS were laid out by the Software manager to the rest of the group and it was then time to go into talks with other groups about what contracts could be made to supply each other with code libraries or other useful tools. This was overseen by the groups project manager, whilst the Software manager decided on what was most needed for the app and where our company could benefit from making contracts with other groups. The inter-group contracts were soon finalised and SWeng group 3 enterprise opened a GitHub repository to which the code for the app could start to be pushed to and monitored closely by the software manager.

			<h4>Final Documentation:</h4>
			The final pieces of documentation to be developed before the first iteration hand in were 2 more financial reports that needed to be written by the financial manager with help from the project manager and then readied for submission by the documentation manager. The first and second financial report would include a financial analysis of our companyâ€™s performance so far as well as a cost analysis section detailing how much money we had spent and how much we would be spending in the future. The whole group got involved in the cost analysis section of these documents to help with compiling the timesheets totalling up the hours completed by each member of the group. Timesheets were filled in weekly by the group members and contained information regarding the task completed, time taken and wage cost.

			<h4>First iteration hand-in:</h4>
			The first iteration was completed and handed in on Friday of week 10 (Spring Term) including all documentation and coding completed up to that point and the final test and integration plan for all modules. By the end of the spring term, a working first iteration of our app had been developed. This first iteration included basic functionality of the application, including the icons, sounds and GUI pages that were to be included in the app. More advanced functionality as well as instructional videos and GUI details were left to be developed for the final hand in of all deliverables.
			This first iteration was all about showing that the application worked and that the idea and functionality outlined in our previous documents was feasible. The collaboration with other groups enabled us to use libraries that would otherwise be unavailable to us and all the code that was written for the app was scrutinized by the lead programmer before it was merged into the master branch of the project. Each member of the group had been given specific tasks to complete during the development of the first iteration that were tracked and updated using numerous Trello boards on the online project tracker 'Trello'. By doing this, it allowed multiple branches to be created which contained code for each of the many sections of the application. Each section could be debugged and updated individually which saved time and effort debugging one huge program and controlling different versions. Once each team member had concluded work on their sections, the merging of the branches into a single coherent application was overseen by the software manager as well as fixing any bugs that appeared and correcting coding style differences to match those laid out in the PWS.
			Once handed in, the group went on a break for Easter in which the consensus was to suspend work operations until team members were all back together again in the following Summer term period. Timesheets were still recorded over the Easter period however as some members wished to continue work outside of the projects core hours. Once the group returned, work could begin on the final stretch of the project working towards the hand in of all deliverables.
