		<h2>Researching the competition:</h2>
		<p>
			After deciding on a direction for our project. The marketing manager began to source information regarding existing apps and market conditions for an app such as this. There are many cooking apps already in circulation, so the aim of this research was to find the general strengths and weaknesses of the current apps and use this to our advantage by making it so that our app solved all the problems that users were having with other apps at the time, therefore making it a more attractive choice to download and use. This research revealed that we should use in-app advertisements to generate income without putting users off with expensive subscription fees. As well as this, the app should be based around minimal contact with the device which was a problem many users had with current apps, as they could not use the app efficiently when they had dirty hands from cooking. With this in mind, we decided to call our app 'Hands Off' as an indication that our app would need minimal contact to use which is what users desired most.
